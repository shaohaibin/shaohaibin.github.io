These algorithms dynamically manage power split between the fuel cell and battery to <strong>maximize system efficiency</strong>, extend operational endurance, and protect components from degradation.</li> <li> <strong>System Integration &amp; Lightweighting:</strong> Significant effort is dedicated to the integration of <strong>lightweight composite hydrogen storage tanks</strong> (Type III and IV) and compact fuel cell stacks to minimize the overall system weight and volume, which is critical for aerial platforms.</li> <li> <strong>Cluster-Level Challenges:</strong> Initial research explores simple cluster energy management, such as <strong>dynamic role assignment</strong> (e.g., shifting leader/follower roles based on remaining energy) and <strong>mission path re-planning</strong> to ensure the entire cluster can complete its objective without individual failures.</li> <li> <strong>Refueling Logistics:</strong> Current systems rely on centralized hydrogen refueling, which presents a logistical challenge for sustained operations of large clusters, especially in remote areas.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Future Development Directions:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <strong>AI-Driven Intelligent EMS:</strong> Future systems will leverage <strong>machine learning and digital twin technologies</strong> to create predictive, self-optimizing EMS. These systems will forecast mission energy demands in real-time and preemptively manage resources for the entire cluster.</li> <li> <strong>Multi-Energy Integration:</strong> Development will move towards <strong>tri-hybrid systems</strong> integrating solar, hydrogen, and batteries. Solar panels could provide in-situ recharging for batteries or even assist in <strong>electrolytic hydrogen production</strong> for ultra-long-endurance missions.</li> <li> <strong>Standardized &amp; Modular Hydrogen Storage:</strong> A key trend is the move to <strong>standardized, swappable hydrogen cartridge systems</strong> (e.g., drawer-type modules). This allows for rapid re-energizing of entire clusters in the field, dramatically improving operational tempo.</li> <li> <strong>Resilient and Decentralized Infrastructure:</strong> Research will focus on <strong>mobile hydrogen refueling stations</strong> and even <strong>on-demand hydrogen production units</strong> (using solar or wind) deployed near the operation area, breaking dependence on fixed infrastructure.</li> <li> <strong>Advanced Cluster Energy Management:</strong> Future directions include <strong>cooperative energy sharing</strong> between unmanned vehicles within a cluster (e.g., mid-air battery swapping or power transfer concepts) and sophisticated algorithms for <strong>energy-aware swarm coordination</strong>, where the mission plan continuously adapts to the collective energy state of the entire swarm.</li> </ul> </body></html>
