**State-of-the-art**

-   **Hybrid Energy Systems:** Most hydrogen-powered unmanned systems (e.g., drones) utilize a hybrid configuration where **hydrogen fuel cells** serve as the primary power source, complemented by **Lithium-ion batteries** for handling peak power demands during take-off, climbing, or maneuvering.
-   **Energy Management Strategies (EMS):** Research focuses on developing rule-based and optimization-based EMS algorithms. These algorithms dynamically manage power split between the fuel cell and battery to **maximize system efficiency**, extend operational endurance, and protect components from degradation.
-   **System Integration & Lightweighting:** Significant effort is dedicated to the integration of **lightweight composite hydrogen storage tanks** (Type III and IV) and compact fuel cell stacks to minimize the overall system weight and volume, which is critical for aerial platforms.
-   **Cluster-Level Challenges:** Initial research explores simple cluster energy management, such as **dynamic role assignment** (e.g., shifting leader/follower roles based on remaining energy) and **mission path re-planning** to ensure the entire cluster can complete its objective without individual failures.
-   **Refueling Logistics:** Current systems rely on centralized hydrogen refueling, which presents a logistical challenge for sustained operations of large clusters, especially in remote areas.

**Future Development Directions:**

-   **AI-Driven Intelligent EMS:** Future systems will leverage **machine learning and digital twin technologies** to create predictive, self-optimizing EMS. These systems will forecast mission energy demands in real-time and preemptively manage resources for the entire cluster.
-   **Multi-Energy Integration:** Development will move towards **tri-hybrid systems** integrating solar, hydrogen, and batteries. Solar panels could provide in-situ recharging for batteries or even assist in **electrolytic hydrogen production** for ultra-long-endurance missions.
-   **Standardized & Modular Hydrogen Storage:** A key trend is the move to **standardized, swappable hydrogen cartridge systems** (e.g., drawer-type modules). This allows for rapid re-energizing of entire clusters in the field, dramatically improving operational tempo.
-   **Resilient and Decentralized Infrastructure:** Research will focus on **mobile hydrogen refueling stations** and even **on-demand hydrogen production units** (using solar or wind) deployed near the operation area, breaking dependence on fixed infrastructure.
-   **Advanced Cluster Energy Management:** Future directions include **cooperative energy sharing** between unmanned vehicles within a cluster (e.g., mid-air battery swapping or power transfer concepts) and sophisticated algorithms for **energy-aware swarm coordination**, where the mission plan continuously adapts to the collective energy state of the entire swarm.
