In this thread of works, we ask:

***How the convergence rate of a diffusively coupled multi-agent network can be drammatically enhanced with less communication links?***

We have established the following results:

1. ***Global network connectivity guarantee via distributed neighbor selection.***
2. ***Convergence rate of the on the multi-agent system on the simplified network can be drammatically enhanced.***
