**State-of-the-art**

1. **Centralized Task Planning**: LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) are used as high-level planners to decompose complex tasks into executable sub-tasks for homogeneous robot swarms, leveraging natural language commands for intuitive human-swarm interaction.  
2. **Decentralized Coordination**: Studies explore LLMs for generating localized behavior rules (e.g., via prompt engineering) to enable emergent coordination, though real-time adaptability remains limited.  
3. **Semantic Communication**: LLMs enhance communication efficiency by translating sensory data into natural language summaries, enabling context-aware information sharing within the swarm.  
4. **Few-Shot Learning**: LLMs facilitate rapid policy adaptation by interpreting few-shot demonstrations or textual instructions, reducing the need for extensive retraining.  
5. **Simulation-Centric Testing**: Most experiments are conducted in simulated environments (e.g., ROS, Gazebo) due to computational constraints and safety concerns.  

**Future Research Directions**  
1. **Real-Time LLM Optimization**: Developing lightweight, edge-deployed LLMs to reduce latency and enable on-board decision-making for dynamic environments.  
2. **Hybrid Architectures**: Integrating LLMs with traditional optimization-based controllers (e.g., MPC) to ensure robustness and safety-critical compliance.  
3. **Cross-Modal Understanding**: Enhancing LLMs to process multi-modal inputs (e.g., vision, lidar) for holistic environment perception and task execution.  
4. **Ethical Frameworks**: Establishing guidelines for LLM-driven swarm autonomy, addressing bias, accountability, and transparent human-swarm collaboration.  
5. **Large-Scale Physical Deployment**: Transitioning from simulation to real-world applications (e.g., disaster response, precision agriculture) with resilient communication protocols.  

**Challenges**: Energy efficiency, scalability, and mitigating LLM hallucinations in safety-sensitive scenarios remain key hurdles. Interdisciplinary efforts combining NLP, robotics, and systems engineering are critical for advancement.
